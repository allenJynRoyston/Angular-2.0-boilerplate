# Angular-2.0 (beta)-boilerplate

### Outdated!  
Check this repo out instead:
https://github.com/allenRoyston/Express-Angular2-Seed

### What Am I?!
A quickstart boilerplate for those who want to dive into [Angular 2.0](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html).  This setup is straight from their main site so essentially just a shortcut to those who want to jump in without all that BORING READING.
  - Open terminal (select a folder for your repo)
  - In terminal, enter:  
  - git clone https://github.com/allenRoyston/Angular-2.0-boilerplate.git
  - cd [name of folder]
  - npm install
  - npm start
  - should automatically open up a browser and start a server, but if it doesn't open localhost:3000
  

### Version
1.0


### Dependencies
- NPM
- Typescript (not required, but you *should* use it.  The .ts file looks WAAAY cleanier than it's .js couterpart)



### License
MIT - go nuts y'all.
